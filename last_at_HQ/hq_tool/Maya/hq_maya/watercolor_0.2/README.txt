==========================================

A test scene has been prepared, to load the scene within Maya (once the system has been installed) follow the next procedures: 
1.- Set your Maya project to the projects folder in the watercolor system directory (Menu, File->Set Project)
2.- Open fruitPlate.ma scene (Menu, File->Open)
3.- The objects will appear green, as the object-shaders are not found in your machine. To fix this, in the WC shelf, right click on the prep shelf button and select "reload all shaders".

==========================================
