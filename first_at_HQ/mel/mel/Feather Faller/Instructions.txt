This tool allows the user to generate falling particles with control over height, speed, banking, spin and much more. The tool actually places expressions on the objects in question. To use, place the objects where you wish them to end up, then apply the settings. This can be done to many multiple objects at the same time.

To Use:

Execute in script editor.

Place the objects where you intend them to end up with any rotation etc.
Select them all and press 'Add Falling Leaf Effect' considering the following settings.

- Leaf Fall Properties

-	Frequency
	The speed in which leaves execute one bank movement.
-	Amplitude
	Amplitude of the banking movement.
-	Bank
	The actual banking amount (rotation ratio) of the
	objects.
-	Spin
	Speed of the spinning movement.
-	Rotation Offset
	Sets the offset of a secondary rotation on the objects.
-	Rotation Speed
	Sets the speed of the secondary rotation.

- Leaf Fall Randomization

This determines the randomization of each of the objects.

- Frames, Duration and Origin Randomization

-	Origin Height
	Sets the height for the objects the start falling.
-	Start Frame
	Dictates when to start the falling.
-	Fall Duration
	How long the falling should last for.
-	End Frame
	What frame the falling should end on.

- Frames, Duration and Origin Randomization

This determines the randomization of each of the objects.

Result:

Upon pressing play the user will see the falling leaf result.
